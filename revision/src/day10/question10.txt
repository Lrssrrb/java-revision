POJO stands for Plain Old Java Object and POJI stands for Plain Old Java Interface. 
Entity beans are replaced by POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes which are simply referred to as entities. 
In EJB3 entity beans are replaced by POJO which can run outside the EJB container and doesnâ€™t require any special interface.

Generally, a POJO class contains variables and their Getters and Setters. 
The POJO classes are similar to Beans as both are used to define the objects to increase the readability and re-usability. 
The only difference between them that Bean Files have some restrictions but, the POJO files do not have any special restrictions.
