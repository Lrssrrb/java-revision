ClassCastException ->
				It is a exeption which arrives when we try to store a higher level class object into lower level Class object.

Example -> 
										C3.java

package test;

public class C3 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			Object o = new Object();
		String s = (String)o;
			System.out.println(s);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println(e.getClass());
		}
		
	}

}


Output ->	class java.lang.ClassCastException


Explain -> 		here I got this Exeption because I am tring to store a "Object" class object o in a "String" class object.
			But "Object" is the parent class of String class thats why I got this Exeption called "ClassCastException" .

	it is like I am tring to store 20 kg thing into a bag which limit is 10 kg.
