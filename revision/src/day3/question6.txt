multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level to prevent ambigty.

Example -> 		suppose 3 classes A,B and C.
			now B class have a method print(),
			and C class also have a method print(),
			now A class extend B and C and call print() method.
			Now compiler can't understand which it have to call.
