Originally there is no difference b/w "==" and "equals()" because the original equals() method is written like

function equals(Object obj){
	return this == obj;
}

but the biggest advantage of equals is that we can override it and make two mathematically uncomparable objects into a logically comparable.

like->
a.name = lucky;
a.age = 20;

b.name = lucky;
b.age = 20;

if we check a==b or a.equals(b) it will be false but we can overridde equals like-

equals(object obj){
	return this.name == obj.name && this.age == obj.age;
}
