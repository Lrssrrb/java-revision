Serialization is used to convert an object into a stream of the byte. 
The byte stream consists of the data of the instance as well as the type of data stored in that instance. 
Deserialization performs exactly opposite operation. 
It converts the byte sequence into original object data. During the serialization, 
when we do not want an object to be serialized we can use a transient keyword.
